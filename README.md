# StageTrack

Hello! This repository is (going to be) all of the code for my Advanced Honors Computer Science project. 
This project is centered around the concept of tracking actors on a stage, which is pretty similar to regular pedestrian detection and tracking.
However, this project is different in that I'm also trying to sync it up to the audio of the script, so that 
the computer can mark in the script when an actor enters or exits the stage.
